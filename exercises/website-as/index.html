                <p>On December 3rd, Israeli forces besieged the Abu Tammam school complex in Beit Lahiya and targeted Palestinian families with American-made weaponry as they fled the shelter. 85% of Gaza's schools have been targeted, and no universities are left standing. We demand that Yale divest from the weapons companies who enable scholasticide and invest in Palestinian scholars and studies because that's what universities ought to be for. Vote YES on Books, Not Bombs before 9 AM on Sunday, and remind your friends to cast their ballots. </p>
