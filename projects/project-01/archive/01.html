                So when I visited the Emirates Stadium for the first time alone, I walked around the visitor zone of the pitch and stands for more than an hour. There were periods of ten minutes where I would simply just take in the beauty of the arena that sat before me. This photo sat on my SD card for multiple months and then my hard drive for even more before I edited it to its final form. Perhaps the periods of no demands, no negotiations, and no expectations are why this photo remains one of my favorites. The nothingness of the process is so beautiful to me.
