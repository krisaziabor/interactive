          <h2>Ad,</h2>
          <p>These photos are some of the most explicit pieces of advertisement I have ever produced. I was tasked with taking photos of More Amour boutique's collection and this was one of the looks.</p>

                <h2>Art?</h2>
                <p>While it's existence as an ad is clear, this photo – and the full photoshoot – were rejected by the Maison board. The photos never made it on the Instagram as it did not fit the aesthetics they wished to advertise for themselves. This piece's dual existence as something accepted by one and rejected by another makes my believe there is art in this.</p>
