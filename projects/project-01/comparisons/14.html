          <p>I was prompted to take these photos by a commission offer and knew by the end of my trip, I needed 30 photos of my traveling to send. I am not sure whether I would've been so committed to sit down for two hours and just hit the shutter if I didn't have that external advertising pressure weighing on me.</p>

                <p>At the same time, I was able to craft my own composition, color, and story. Everything was in my hands and I was able to capture these chairs and their withering paint – something that you never see on the TV broadcasts of Emirates Stadium from your home. Getting up close and admiring these imperfections brings out the art in this photo.</p>
