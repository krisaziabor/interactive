            This and many other I took on that night received so much praise from my peers that I began to start publicly sharing my work once more â€“ 
            the first time since 2018.
            <br>
            At the same time, the social location and context of this shot leaves my current perception of this work to be a lot more complex. 
            Are my photos an explicit endorsement of my clients, their aesthetics and their values?
