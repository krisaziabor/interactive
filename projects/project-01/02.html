        This photo holds a bizarre place in my heart.
    <h3>///</h3>
    <p>
        This and many other I took on that night received so much praise from my peers that I began to start publicly sharing my work once more – 
        the first time since 2018.
        <br>
        At the same time, the social location and context of this shot – The Edon Club – leaves my current perception of this work to be a lot more complex. 
        Are my photos an explicit endorsement of my clients, their aesthetics and their values?
