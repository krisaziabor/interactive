        I do not usually associate my practice or traditions of photography with tranquility or peace.
       <br> 
        That is not to say I have not enjoyed my days of shutter presses and Lightroom tweaks, but everything is rushed. 
        Every photo I produce comes with a deadline imposed by someone else, an aesthetic foreign to the one I have curated, and expectations 
        and aspirations that sometimes directly counter my own.</p>

        So when I visited the Emirates Stadium for the first time alone, I walked around the visitor zone of the pitch and stands for more than an hour. There were periods of ten minutes where I would simply just take in the beauty of the arena that sit before me. This photo sat on my SD card for multiple months and then my hard drive for even more before I edited it to its final form. Perhaps the periods of no demands, no negotiations and no expectations are why this photo remains one of my favorites. The nothingness of the process is so beautiful to me.
