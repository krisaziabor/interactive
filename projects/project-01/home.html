        <strong>Ad or art?</strong> is a collection of 30 photos that I had
        taken in my first two years of Yale. Desperate for a student job and
        also some artistic fulfillment, I threw myself into the photography
        world on campus in any way that I could find. Weekly freelance gigs, a
        job as a production archivist, and multiple photographer positions in
        clubs meant there was hardly a time I was not holding a camera. Now that
        I have taken my finger off the shutter (temporarily), I ask myself, what
        of my work is advertisement and what is art? All art is promoting some
        belief, aesthetic, or story. But an advertisement is different because
        it supports an existing system. Art disrupts it. This site holds 15
        pairs of work that have been beloved but also discarded by my clients,
        bosses, and peers. In the end, this is an attempt for me to reflect on
        the ways I sold my labor of love to others and what is left for me in
        the end. &lt;3 <br /><br />
